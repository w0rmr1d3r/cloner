## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open an issue using the vulnerability template [here](https://github.com/w0rmr1d3r/cloner/issues). Really appreciate it :)

## Timeline expectations

There are no fixed dates or times since a vuln gets reported until it gets fixed. Although I'll try to solve it within the first 30 days after the issue has been reported.
